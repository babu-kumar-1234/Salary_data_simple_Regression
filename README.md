Model Performance
Our model achieves high R2 scores:

- Training R2 Score: 0.9559 (95.59% of variance explained)
- Testing R2 Score: 0.9440 (94.40% of variance explained)

Interpretation
- Excellent fit: High R2 scores indicate that the model explains a large portion of the variance in the data.
- Good generalization: The testing R2 score is close to the training R2 score, suggesting that the model generalizes well to unseen data.

Key Takeaways
- The model demonstrates strong predictive capabilities.
- The high R2 scores suggest that the model is a good fit for the data.

Potential Applications
- This model can be used for predicting continuous outcomes.
- It may be useful in applications where understanding the relationship between features and the target variable is important.
